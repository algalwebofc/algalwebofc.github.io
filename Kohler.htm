    <p class="style1">Setting up Köhler Illumination on your microscope:</p>
    <p class="style1"><br>
      1. Place a specimen on the stage and focus on it (your microscope must be at 
      least roughly set up to do this). <br>
      2. Reduce the aperture of the field iris diaphragm (located nearest the light 
      source) so that you can see its edges. <br>
      3. Bring the edges of the field iris into focus by focusing the <u>condenser</u>. 
      Both the specimen and the iris should now be in focus. <br>
      4. Center the field iris using the two condenser-centering knobs.<br>
      5. Adjust the condenser iris (immediately below the condenser) to reduce glare 
      around the edge of the field iris.<br>
      6. Open the field iris so the edges lie just beyond the field of view. The condenser 
      iris can be adjusted slightly to optimise image contrast. <br>
      7. Do not use the condenser iris to adjust light intensity. Use the adjustable 
      lamp power supply (which will change the colour rendition), <br>
      or (for color photography) 
      with neutral density filters placed between the lamp and the field iris. <br>
