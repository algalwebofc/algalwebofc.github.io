<P> Identification of freshwater algae appears a daunting task to the novice, 
  but a little practice will soon bring rewards. Most of the algae are microscopic, 
  or need close examination to identify, so a good compound microscope is esssential. 
</P>
<P> This Guide covers sample collection, preservation, examination and identification. 
</P>
<P> <B>Sample collection</B> </P>
<P> The first thing to consider is how you collect your specimens. Basically, 
  there are two main growth strategies for algae, either to grow on a surface 
  (periphytic), or to float in the water (planktonic), and the collection technique 
  must take account of this. (Some algae grow epiphytically, and there are also 
  algae which grow endophytically - within cells of higher plants).</P>
<P><B> Plankton</B></P>
<P> Plankton samples are most conveniently taken with a net (mesh size about 50 
  micrometres (µm.)). This concentrates the sample, but at the cost of possibly 
  losing some of the very small plankters (microplankton). The method is qualitative, 
  or at best, semi-quantitative (as it is hard to know how much water has actually 
  passed through your net). The net will also collect all the zooplankton, which 
  will start to graze your algae. Adding preservative will kill the zooplankton, 
  but there are disadvantages in this for algal identification. Sieves may be 
  used to strain out the larger animals, but the smaller grazers (eg. rotifers) 
  will remain, and will graze the microplankton.</P>
<P> A water sample of known volume can be taken and allowed to settle, to concentrate 
  it. This will take a long time, and preservative will need to be added. Samples 
  can also be filtered through membrane filters which are then examined directly 
  under the microscope. The filter and sample may need special treatment to clear 
  it for microscopical examination.</P>
<P><B> Periphyton</B></P>
<P> "Periphyton" actually refers to <U>all</U> organisms growing attached to a 
  surface, and includes bacteria, algae, protozoa, and microscopic multicellular 
  animals. I am restricting this discussion to algae. Sampling technique differs 
  according to the surface in question, which varies from rocks (epilithic) to 
  mud (epipelic), as well as vegetation (epiphytic growth). </P>
<P> Soft sediments can be scraped with a spoon or other implement to sample the 
  growth, while rocks can be scraped with a blade, or more conveniently a fingernail, 
  and stones can be lifted from the water and brushed into a container using an 
  old paintbrush or toothbrush. This can be used to obtain a qualitative estimate 
  of species coverage, as a known area can be harvested, but the vigorous brushing 
  can make identification of some species tricky. For best viewing, picking with 
  the fingers is best.</P>
<P> Samples should be collected into a container half filled with a much larger 
  volume of water than the sample: densely packed samples will soon start to decompose.</P>
<P><B> Alternative sampling techniques</B></P>
<P> Periphyton can be sampled on artificial surfaces which you place in the water 
  for a period of time. The most useful surface is a microscope slide, as you 
  can then examine your catch directly on the microscope. Apparatus can be devised 
  for holding the slides, either attached to a float or a brick (for example). 
  A reasonable growth of periphyton will be found aftr a week or so, but the algae 
  will be quite densely packed on the slide. I have found that exposing the slides 
  in a pond for about 24 hours then incubating them in filtered pond water for 
  2-3 weeks gives well-spaced young algal plants for identification (see the pages 
  on <I>Stigeoclonium</I> identification). If possible incubate in a vessel floating 
  in the pond. Colonisation in running water is usually slower.</P>
<P><B> Preservation (or not)</B></P>
<P> For best results, look at the samples while they are still fresh, as all preservatives 
  have their disadvantages. Lugol's Iodine is widely used and appears to work 
  well with diatoms and some green algae, so long as it is not used in excess 
  (enough is added to turn the sample a "pale straw colour", about 0.3 ml per 
  100ml sample, but the amount needed varies with the amount of algal material 
  in the sample). Some filamentous Zygnematacean algae, however, break up readily 
  in Lugol's; also the iodine reacts with starch, showing up pyrenoids (a useful 
  diagnostic test), but altering the colour which causes problems with some algae, 
  e.g. cyanophyes. I have used 4% formalin to avoid these problems, but it is 
  extremely toxic and air extraction must be used at all times with treated samples. 
  It also disrupts the structure of some algae. Glutaraldehyde is reported to 
  be better, but is also toxic. For a discussion of preservatives see<A HREF="http://www.botany.wisc.edu/courses/botany_330/preservation.html"> 
  this</A> site.</P>
<P> <B> Not:</B></P>
<P> Fresh plankton samples need the most immediate attention as grazing zooplankton 
  can decimate your sample. Periphyton samples do not suffer the same problem, 
  because the algae are larger and there tend to be few grazers anyway, though 
  Chironomid larvae can chomp through filamentous algae quite alarmingly. Periphyton 
  samples will keep quite happily in a fridge for several weeks or longer, provided 
  the algae are not too crowded.</P>
<P> I have recently examined filtered phytoplankton sampled which were stored 
  in a dark fridge for more than 10 months, and found that some algae, especially 
  desmids, had survived, as had some zooplankton.</P>
<P><B> Examination</B></P>
<P> Set your microscope up for <A HREF="Kohler.htm">Köhler</A> illumination *</P>
<P> Spread your sample thinly on a slide and place a coverslip on top. Scan using 
  the X10 objective, then switch to a higher power when you find something interesting. 
  Modern microscopes are fitted with parfocal lenses: they should be more or less 
  in focus when you swing a different objective in (unless someone has fitted 
  a lens from a different make or model). Focus up and down to view the object's 
  upper surface, circumference, and (sometimes) lower surface. The 3-dimensional 
  nature of algal cells can make them difficult to view (and photograph sucessfully), 
  but shutting down the condenser iris a little can help by giving a greater depth 
  of field.</P>
<P><B> Identification</B></P>
<P> I routinely use the following keys:</P>
<ul>
  <li>EJ Cox, 1996: Identification of Freshwater Diatoms from Live Material; Chapman 
    and Hall, London, ISBN 0 412 49380 2 </li>
  <li>DM John, BA Whitton and AJ Brook, 2002: The Freshwater Algal Flora of the 
    British Isles, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. ISBN 0 521 77051 3 </li>
  <li>EM Lind and AJ Brook, 1980: Desmids of the English Lake District; Freshwater 
    Biological Asociation, Ambleside. ISBN 0 900386 40 1 </li>
  <li>GW Prescott,1970: How to Know the Freshwater Algae; Wm C Brown, Dubuque. 
  </li>
</ul>
<P> Prescott was my only key for a long time and I still find it useful for a 
  quick guide to possible ID, but it is out of date and many of the names have 
  been changed. Similarly Lind and Brook is useful mainly for its portability. 
  The best current key is John, Whitton and Brook, with current nomenclature and 
  a fairly extensive coverage of British algae. However, it does not cover identification 
  of diatoms. Cox is my choice here, especially as it allows you to identify fresh 
  samples (without extensive treatment and mounting), but the book is currently 
  out of print (taken over by Kluwer publishers). </P>
<P> Learning to use a key is a bit of a slog. You need to familiarise yourself 
  with the terminology and look for the key characteristics in your unknown sample. 
  The illustrations are a good guide to an identification, but you may need to 
  plough through a key as well to confirm your ID. I hope the photographs on these 
  pages help.</P>
