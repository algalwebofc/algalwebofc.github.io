<P>1&#9;<U>Indicators</U>: the concept of biological indicators. (see the US EPA's site on 
<A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/ceisweb1/ceishome/atlas/bioindicators/periphyton_as_indicators.html">
periphyton as indicators</A>)</P>
<P>&#9;Biological communities are composed of species each of which has its own preferred 
conditions for survival. Therefore the makeup of a community (the proportions of the various 
species = <B>community structure</B>) is a reflection of the environmental conditions at a 
particular time and place: the community structure is an ecological indicator of those 
conditions.</P>
<P>&#9;This relationship has been widely used in the monitoring of streamwater pollution, using 
macroinvertebrate communities.<IMG SRC="plecop2.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=49> It has also been found
 that certain algal groups are useful indicators. 
<A HREF="http://www.indiana.edu/~diatom/diatom.html">Diatoms</A> in particular leave behind 
their silica frustules <A HREF="http://www.bgsu.edu/Departments/biology/algae/index.html">
<IMG SRC="dip2.jpg" BORDER=0 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=40></A> (cell cases) as fossil remains, by which 
they can be identified in sediments, and have been useful in the reconstruction of pH changes 
in lakes. Chrysophytes also have silicaceous wall parts which are preserved in sediments and 
these have recently been found useful indicators of changes in pH, salinity, phosphorus and 
metal concentrations in lake waters.</P>
<P>Filamentous benthic algae leave no fossil remains but their community structure 
  is a good indicator of low-pH conditions in which few diatom species survive 
  (Kinross <I>et al,</I> 1993).<BR><BR>
  Project 1: Remaining questions of interest are: how does the (normal) longitudinal 
  gradient in pH within a single stream (pH lowest near the source) influence 
  the community structure, and is this independent of the parallel change in stream 
  size?</P>
<P>Is the relationship between filamentous algal community structure and streamwater 
  chemistry due to direct pH preferences, or a secondary effect due to elimination 
  of invertebrate grazers, for example? A test of growth rates of various species 
  at different pH's showed that those most commonly found in low-pH streams had 
  a growth rate optimum at a lower pH than those more common at higher pH (Kinross 
  <I>et al,</I> 2000.). In the absence of grazing, greens dominate below pH 5, 
  and diatoms above. (see photograph below)<BR>

for postgraduate short project. 
<P>2&#9;<U>Molecular ecological studies</u></P>
<P>Identification of many algae to species level is problematic due to phenotypic plasticity 
(the tendency to different growth forms in response to different environmental conditions), and 
the necessity to observe the products of sexual reproduction in some other genera. <BR> Project 
3: A possible resolution to this problem may come from molecular studies such as 'genetic 
fingerprinting'. This approach may also shed light on the degree of relatedness of algal 
populations from adjacent watersheds - of interest as it would indicate how isolated such 
populations are, and whether genetic drift and species differentiation could occur (since some 
filamentous green algae appear <I>not </I>to have a sexual means of reproduction, these should 
show greater differences than sexually reproducing species).</P>
<P>3&#9;<U>Use of algae in wastewater treatment</u></P>
<P>Algal mats are able to strip nutrients from solution. This could form the basis of 
biological tertiary treatment of wastewaters. <BR>Project 4: A pilot study is under way into 
the nutrient stripping potential of green algal mats and Duckweed (<I>Lemna</I>) -see 
photograph.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="lemna.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=120></P>
<P>4&#9;<U>Autecology of algae </u></P>
<P>Species within a single are by definition closely related and will have similar 
environmental requirements (similar niches), so how did they evolve into different species 
at all? Are there detectable differences between species' environmental preferences? </P>
<P>Many green algal species occur in the same (apparent) habitat as others of the same genus 
(eg <I>Mougeotia, Oedogonium</I>), permitting tests of this hypothesis: <BR>Project 5: 
Differences may exist in tolerance to high/low light levels, pH, temperature, response to 
nutrients (including micronutrients), desiccation, or susceptibility to grazing.</P>
