These images were produced at Napier University using a Leitz Laborlux S microscope fitted with a Diagnostic Instruments SPOT digital camera and software.<br> 
Images of the stage micrometer at the same magnification were superimposed using Paint Shop Pro 5.

Note the fibrils extending through the gelatinous envelope in the <I>Tetraspora</I> colony. Many of the common algae in this pond have setae or chaetae: I wonder why?<BR>

Oedogonium species are characterised by the cell wall structure: cell division results in rings at the end of the cells. This is not so clear in some smaller species, but the cells tend to be slightly wider at one end than the other. The basal disc is found in all <I> Oedogonium</I> species, and some other genera (see the <I>Tetraspora</I> above)<BR>
