<blockquote>
  <p align="CENTER"><FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE=3>Phylum Chlorophyta, sub-phylum Chlorophyceae, 
    order Zygnematales, fam. Zygnemataceae.</font></p>

  
      <p><FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE=3><I>Mougeotia</i> species are unbranched filamentous 
            green algae. The cell wall is characteristically straight and parallel-sided 
            (compare with <I>Oedogonium, Microspora</I> or <I>Stigeoclonium</I>, which 
            sometimes have bulbous cells). They have a single chloroplast in the form 
            of an axial plate or ribbon which usually almost fills the length of the cell. 
            The chloroplast may be seen lying flat (horizontal) when seen through the 
            microscope, or it may be twisted and can sometimes be seen as a narrow strip 
            up the middle of the cell. There are several pyrenoids which are starch containing 
            bodies and can be revealed by staining with Lugol's iodine (the starch turns 
            black). </font></p>
      <p><FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE=3>Unfortunately, many <I>Mougeotia</I> species are 
            sensitive to iodine, and pressure, and the filaments may break up, so the 
            iodine test should be performed after first examining the fresh material. 
        </font></p>
      <p><FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE=3><I>Mougeotia </i>are members of the Zygnematales 
            or Conjugales, which as the name suggests enjoy <A HREF="sex.htm">sexual reproduction</A>; 
            neighbouring filaments send out processes which fuse into a tube, then the 
            cell contents pass into the conjugation tube and form the zygospore. The appearance 
            of the zygospore is used to identify to species, but this characteristic is 
            rarely found in field material. Many species show <U>scalariform</U> conjugation; 
            many adjoining cells in the two filaments form conjugation tubes at the same 
            time, giving the appearance of a ladder. Other common members of the Conjugales 
            are <I>Zygnema</I> and <I>Spirogyra</I>. </font></p>
      <p><FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE=3>Filaments sometimes produce short lateral, rhizoidal 
            extensions, in a similar manner to the extensions which form the conjugation 
            tube. These may be in response to contact with a surface (the basal attachment 
            has a similar rhizoidal appearance), but the branch so formed is always very 
            short, and this is a rare occurrence.</font></p>

            5-8µm.) is the smallest species regularly found in low-pH waters. The following
